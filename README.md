# 10-Q Equity Research Agent

**Live app:** https://10q-equity-agent-esldzub5xgfc3j8mcc8u42.streamlit.app/

Enter any US-listed ticker. Pulls its real, latest 10-Q from SEC EDGAR
(free, public, no key), computes standard financial ratios from the
filing's actual structured (XBRL) data, then runs a 5-step LLM research
pipeline against the real filing text to produce a quantitative snapshot,
a risk synthesis, a narrative-vs-numbers consistency check, a capital
allocation read, and a final equity research stance.

## Why this exists

An earlier version of this ([`amazon-10q-agent`](https://github.com)) worked
against one hardcoded company's static PDF and Excel export. This version
works against any real US filer, live, using the same standardized data
every public company reports to the SEC — no manual data prep per company.

## Architecture

```
ticker input
    │
    ▼
core/edgar_client.py    ── SEC EDGAR: ticker → CIK → latest 10-Q filing
    │                       + structured XBRL financial facts
    ▼
core/ratios.py          ── profitability / liquidity / leverage / cash flow /
    │                       YoY ratios, computed from the filing's own XBRL
    │                       data (not hardcoded row labels) -- works for any
    │                       filer's actual reported figures
    ▼
services/pipeline.py    ── 5 sequential LLM steps, each grounded in the
    │                       previous steps' real output, not 5 independent
    │                       prompts against the same raw context
    ▼
app.py                  ── Streamlit router: views/analyze.py (live analysis)
                           + views/track_record.py (backtest results)
```

## Track record

The app's **Track Record** page shows how the agent's calls held up. The
backtest covers 20 large-caps, one 10-Q each (filed Oct 2025 – Feb 2026),
and each run uses only the data available on that filing's date. Every call
is scored two ways:

- **Against the stock's actual 90-day move.** The agent's Bullish/Bearish
  calls were right 8 of 12 times.
- **Against Wall Street consensus on the same date.** The consensus is
  rebuilt from dated analyst ratings (`core/analyst_consensus.py`). The
  agent agreed with the Street on 7 of 18 filings (2 had no rating history).
  When it made a different directional call, it was right 4 of 5 times.
  When it stayed Neutral on names the Street rated Buy, the Street was right
  6 of 6 times.

This is a small, single-quarter sample in a mostly rising market, so none of
these numbers show real predictive power.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-backtest.txt
python scripts/backtest_accuracy.py      # LLM runs -> docs/backtest/results.csv
python scripts/analyst_comparison.py     # no LLM -> docs/backtest/analyst_comparison.csv
python -m pytest tests                   # consensus logic unit tests
```

### A few things worth knowing about how this actually works

- **Ratios are computed from real XBRL facts, not text-parsed from a PDF.**
  Every US public company tags its financial statements with standardized
  concepts (`us-gaap:Revenues`, `us-gaap:OperatingIncomeLoss`, etc.) as part
  of its SEC filing. `core/ratios.py` reads those directly.
- **XBRL duration handling is non-trivial and got it wrong on the first
  pass.** The same concept is tagged at multiple durations (a quarter, a
  6-month YTD, a full fiscal year) under one tag, and companies sometimes
  retire one tag name for another over time. An early version of this
  mixed a quarterly revenue figure against an annual cost figure and
  produced a nonsense 13% gross margin for Apple. Fixed by merging all
  fallback tag names before picking the freshest point (instead of
  stopping at the first tag with *any* data) and isolating a true single
  quarter — directly if tagged, or by subtracting the prior YTD figure
  from the current one when the filer only tags cash-flow items
  cumulatively (the common case).
- **Cross-metric ratios are period-aligned before they're computed.** If
  two facts feeding one ratio (e.g. operating income and interest expense)
  come from different reporting periods — which happens when a company
  stops tagging one line item — the ratio is reported as unavailable
  rather than silently computed from mismatched periods.
- **Bank filers correctly return `null` for ratios that don't apply to
  them.** JPMorgan doesn't report "cost of revenue" or "current assets"
  the way an industrial company does; rather than force industrial-company
  ratio formulas onto a bank's balance sheet, missing concepts are
  reported as gaps, not guessed at.
- **The filing-text fetch is anchored on the actual MD&A section heading,
  not a fixed byte offset.** A modern 10-Q's inline-XBRL markup can carry
  tens of thousands of characters of tagging metadata before any
  human-readable prose starts; slicing raw HTML by a fixed offset returned
  nothing but tag noise on the first pass. Fixed by stripping to plain
  text and searching for the real "Management's Discussion and Analysis"
  heading (the *last* occurrence, since the first is the table of
  contents).
